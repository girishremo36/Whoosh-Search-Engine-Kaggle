Description
Inventions are legally protected by patents. Governments grant patents to inventors, offering exclusive rights for a defined period in exchange for public disclosure to foster innovation in various fields. But before an inventor can obtain a patent, a patent professional must assess whether the invention meets the necessary criteria. AI-powered search tools could help patent professionals streamline these tasks.

When using search tools, patent professionals receive certain information on documents in the result set. This information may include text and metadata snippets (such as the classification term(s)) that played a significant role in selecting included information, as well as quantitative measures such as similarity scores. However, this provided information may not always fully explain why the specific documents in the result set were returned. Patent professionals are most familiar with leveraging and reading Boolean search expressions to determine whether they have sufficiently searched the patent space.

About the USPTO
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is the federal agency for granting U.S. patents and registering trademarks. The USPTO advises the President of the United States, the Secretary of Commerce, and U.S. government agencies on intellectual property (IP) policy, protection, and enforcement; and promotes stronger and more effective IP protection around the world. The agency also provides training, education, and capacity-building programs designed to foster respect for IP and encourage the development of strong IP enforcement regimes by U.S. trading partners.

The USPTO offers one of the largest repositories of scientific, technical, and commercial information in the world through its Open Data Portal. Patents are a form of intellectual property granted in exchange for the public disclosure of new and useful inventions. Because patents undergo an intensive vetting process prior to grant, and because the history of U.S. innovation spans over two centuries and 11 million patents, the U.S. patent archives stand as a rare combination of data volume, quality, and diversity.

Objective of this project was to create a fully functioning search query to find if the said patent exists or not.
