# ðŸš€ Description
This project is based on the kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/uspto-explainable-ai

It involves the creation of a search engine aimed at querying patent data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The initiative is inspired by the Kaggle competition, which focuses on developing explainable AI solutions for patent professionals.

Inventions are protected by patents, granted by governments to inventors in exchange for public disclosure. Patent professionals assess inventions against specific criteria before granting patents. AI-powered search tools can aid in streamlining these tasks by providing information such as text snippets, metadata (e.g., classification terms), and similarity scores from search results. However, understanding why specific documents are included in the results can be challenging.

Patent professionals often rely on Boolean search expressions to ensure comprehensive searches of the patent space. This project aims to leverage AI to enhance search capabilities, making it easier to determine the existence of patents based on user queries.

# :page_facing_up: About USPTO
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is a federal agency responsible for granting U.S. patents and registering trademarks. It advises government bodies on intellectual property (IP) policy and promotes global IP protection and enforcement. The USPTO manages a vast repository of scientific, technical, and commercial information through its Open Data Portal, comprising over 11 million patents spanning more than two centuries.

# :page_facing_up: Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a fully functional search query tool capable of determining the existence of a patent based on user input. It utilizes Whoosh which is a fast, featureful full-text indexing and searching library implemented in pure Python. to enhance search accuracy and efficiency for patent professionals and researchers.
